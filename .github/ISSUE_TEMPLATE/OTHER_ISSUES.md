The [readme](https://github.com/l3uddz/traktarr/blob/master/README.md) page is very detailed and updated often. It should be the first thing used to find the answers to your questions.

If you still have a support question, use the [Discord](https://discord.io/cloudbox) chat server to post your question in the `#traktarr` channel.

Support questions or requests will be redirected there and the issue ticket will be closed.
