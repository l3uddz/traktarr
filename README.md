  },
  "trakt": {
    "client_id": "",
    "client_secret": ""
  }
}
```


## Core

```json
"core": {
  "debug": false
},
```

`debug` - Toggle debug messages in the log. Default is `false`.

  - Set to `true`, if you are having issues and want to diagnose why.


## Automatic
Used for automatic / scheduled traktarr tasks.

Movies can be run on a separate schedule then from Shows.

_Note: These settings are only needed if you plan to use traktarr on a schedule (vs just using it as a CLI command only; see [Usage](#usage))._

```json
"automatic": {
  "movies": {
    "anticipated": 3,
    "boxoffice": 10,
    "interval": 24,
    "popular": 3,
    "trending": 2,
    "watched": 2,
    "played_all": 2,
    "watchlist": {},
    "lists": {},
  },
  "shows": {
    "anticipated": 10,
    "interval": 48,
    "popular": 1,
    "trending": 2,
    "watched_monthly": 2,
    "played": 2,
    "watchlist": {},
    "lists": {}
  }
},
```

`interval` - Specify how often (in hours) to run traktarr task.

`anticipated`, `popular`, `trending`, `boxoffice` (movies only) - Specify how many items from each Trakt list to find.

`watched` - Adds items that are the most watched by unique Trakt users (mutliple viewings excluded).

  - `watched` / `watched_weekly` - Most watched in the week.

  - `watched_monthly` - Most watched in the month.

  - `watched_yearly` - Most watched in the year.

  - `watched_all` - Most watched of all time.

`played` - Adds items that are most the played items by Trakt users (mutliple viewings included).

  - `played` / `played_weekly` - Most played in the week.

  - `played_monthly` - Most played in the month.

  - `played_yearly` - Most played in the year.

  - `played_all` Most played of all time.

`watchlist` - Specify which watchlists to fetch (see explanation below).

`lists` - Specify which custom lists to fetch (see explanation below).

### Personal Watchlists

The watchlist task can be scheduled with a differtent item limit for every (authenticated) user.


So for every user, you will add: `"username": limit` to the watchlist key. For example:

```json
"automatic": {
  "movies": {
    "watchlist": {
        "user1": 10,
        "user2": 5
    }
  },
  "shows": {
    "watchlist": {
        "user1": 2,
        "user3": 1
    }
  }
},
```

Of course you can combine this with running the other list types as well.

### Custom Lists

You can also schedule any number of public or private custom lists.

For both public and private lists you'll need the url to that list. When viewing the list on Trakt, simply copy the url from the address bar of the your browser.

#### Public Lists

Public lists can be added by specifying the url and the item limit like this:

```json
"automatic": {
  "movies": {
    "lists": {
        "https://trakt.tv/users/rkerwin/lists/top-100-movies": 10
    }
  },
  "shows": {
    "lists": {
        "https://trakt.tv/users/claireaa/lists/top-100-tv-shows-of-all-time-ign": 10
    }
  }
},
```


#### Private Lists

Private lists can be added in two ways:

1. If there is only one authenticated user, you can add the private list just like any other public list:

   ```json
   "automatic": {
     "movies": {
       "lists": {
           "https://trakt.tv/users/user/lists/my-private-movies-list": 10
       }
     },
     "shows": {
       "lists": {
           "https://trakt.tv/users/user/lists/my-private-shows-list": 10
       }
     }
   },
   ```

2. If there are multiple authenticated users you want to fetch the lists from, you'll need to specify the username under `authenticate_as`.

   _Note: The user should have access to the list (either own the list or a list that was shared to them by a friend)._

   ```json
   "automatic": {
     "movies": {
       "lists": {
           "https://trakt.tv/users/user/lists/my-private-movies-list": {
               "authenticate_as": "user2",
               "limit": 10
           }
       }
     },
     "shows": {
       "lists": {
           "https://trakt.tv/users/user/lists/my-private-shows-list": {
               "authenticate_as": "user2",
               "limit": 10
           }
       }
     }
   },
   ```


## Filters

Use filters to specify the movie/shows's country of origin or blacklist (i.e. filter-out) certain keywords, genres, years, runtime, or specific movies/shows.

### Movies

```json
  "movies": {
    "disabled_for": [],
    "allowed_countries": [
      "us",
      "gb",
      "ca"
    ],
    "allowed_languages": [],
    "blacklist_title_keywords": [
      "untitled",
      "barbie"
    ],
    "blacklisted_genres": [
      "documentary",
      "music",
      "animation"
    ],
    "blacklisted_max_year": 2019,
    "blacklisted_min_runtime": 60,
    "blacklisted_min_year": 2000,
    "blacklisted_tmdb_ids": []
  },
```

`disabled_for` - Specify for which lists the blacklist is disabled for, when running in automatic mode.

- This is similar to running `--ignore-blacklist` via the CLI command.

Example:

```
    "disabled_for": [
        "anticipated",
        "watchlist:user1",
        "list:http://url-to-list"
    ],
```

`allowed_countries` - Only add movies from these countries. Listed as two-letter country codes.

- [List of available country codes](list_of_country_codes.md).

`allowed_languages` - Only add movies with these languages. Listed as two-letter language codes.

- Languages are in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) format (e.g. `ja` for Japanese.)

- [List of available language codes](list_of_language_codes.md).

`blacklist_title_keywords` - blacklist certain words in titles.

`blacklisted_genres` - Blacklist certain genres.

  - [List of available genres](list_of_movie_genres.md).

  - For an updated list, visit [here](https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/#reference/genres/list/get-genres).

`blacklisted_max_year` - Blacklist release dates after specified year.

`blacklisted_min_runtime` - Blacklist runtime duration lower than specified time (in minutes).

`blacklisted_min_year` - Blacklist release dates before specified year.

`blacklisted_tmdb_ids` - Blacklist certain movies with their TMDB IDs.

## Notifications

Notification alerts for traktarr tasks.

_Note: Manual commands need the `--notifications` flag._

Currently, only Pushover and Slack are supported. More will be added later.


```json
"notifications": {
  "pushover": {
    "service": "pushover",
    "app_token": "",
    "user_token": "",
    "priority": 0
  },
  "slack": {
    "service": "slack",
    "webhook_url": ""
  },
  "verbose": true
},
```

`verbose` - Toggle detailed notifications. Default is `true`.

  - Set to `false`, if you want to reduce the amount of detailed notifications (e.g. the names of the movies/shows added vs just the total).


### Pushover

`app_token` and `user_token` - Retrieve from Pushover.net.

You can specify a priority for the messages send via Pushover using the `priority` key. It can be any Pushover priority value (https://pushover.net/api#priority).

_Note: The key name (i.e the name right under notifications) can be anything, but the `"service":` must be exactly `"pushover"`._


### Slack

`webhook_url` - Webhook URL you get after creating an "Incoming Webhook" under "Custom Integrations".

_Note: The key name (i.e the name right under notifications) can be anything, but the `"service":` must be exactly `"slack"`._


## Radarr

Radarr configuration.

```json
"radarr": {
  "api_key": "",
  "profile": "HD-1080p",
  "root_folder": "/movies/",
  "url": "http://localhost:7878"
},
```
`api_key` - Radarr's API Key.

`profile` - Profile that movies are assigned to.

`root_folder` - Root folder for movies.

`url` - Radarr's URL.


## Sonarr

Sonarr configuration.


```json
"sonarr": {
  "api_key": "",
  "profile": "HD-1080p",
  "root_folder": "/tv/",
  "tags": {},
  "url": "http://localhost:8989"
},
```

`api_key` - Sonarr's API Key.

`profile` - Profile that TV shows are assigned to.

`root_folder` - Root folder for TV shows.

`tags` - Assign tags to shows based the network it airs on. More details on this below.

`url` - Sonarr's URL.


### Tags

The `tags` option allows Sonarr to assign tags to shows from specific television networks, so that Sonarr can filter in/out certain keywords from releases.

**Example:**

To show how tags work, we will create a tag `AMZN` and assign it to certain television networks that usually have AMZN releases.

1. First, we will create a tag in Sonarr (Settings > Indexers > Restrictions).

   ```
   Must contain: BluRay, Amazon, AMZN
   Must not contain:
   Tags: AMZN
   ```

2. And, finally, we will edit the traktarr config and assign the `AMZN` tag to some networks.

   ```json
   "tags": {
     "amzn": [
       "hbo",
       "amc",
       "usa network",
       "tnt",
       "starz",
       "the cw",

     ]
   }
   ```

## Trakt

  "client_id": "",
  "client_secret": ""
}
```

`client_id` - Fill in your Trakt API key (_Client ID_).

`client_secret` - Fill in your Trakt Secret key (_Client Secret_)


# Usage

## Automatic (Scheduled)

### Setup

To have traktarr get Movies and Shows for you automatically, on set interval, do the following:

1. `sudo cp /opt/traktarr/systemd/traktarr.service /etc/systemd/system/`

2. `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/traktarr.service` and edit user/group to match yours' (run `id` to check).

3. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

4. `sudo systemctl enable traktarr.service`

5. `sudo systemctl start traktarr.service`

### Customize

You can customize how the scheduled traktarr is ran by editing the `traktarr.service` file and adding any of the following options:

\* Remember, other configuration options need to go into the `config.json` file under the `Automatic` section.

```
traktarr run --help
```

```
Usage: traktarr run [OPTIONS]

  Run in automatic mode.

Options:
  -d, --add-delay FLOAT           Seconds between each add request to Sonarr /
                                  Radarr.  [default: 2.5]
  -s, --sort [votes|rating|release]
                                  Sort list to process.
  --no-search                     Disable search when adding to Sonarr /
                                  Radarr.
  --run-now                       Do a first run immediately without waiting.
  --no-notifications              Disable notifications.
  --ignore-blacklist              Ignores the blacklist when running the
                                  command.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```
